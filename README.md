# ReLearning_R
Revising and learning new R code now that I do not have access to Stata!

## Project 1: R for Data Science Book
Working through the "R for Data Science" book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/
Suggested answers to exercises: https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions.


## Other ideas:
- work through Nicola's blog for data visualisations
- create website
- volunteering projects for RSS using only R
